# 🧪 Diabetes Progression Prediction — Lab 2

This project is a practical lab for multivariate regression and non-parametric modeling using the [Scikit-Learn Diabetes Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#diabetes-dataset). The goal is to build, evaluate, and compare different machine learning models to predict the progression of diabetes one year after baseline based on various health features.

## 📁 Contents

- `lab2_Multi.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with code, visualizations, and results
- `requirements.txt`: Frozen list of required Python packages
- `README.md`: You're reading it!

## 🚀 Objectives

- Load and explore the diabetes dataset
- Perform univariate polynomial regression (degrees 0–5) using BMI
- Train and evaluate multivariate models:
  - Polynomial regression
  - Decision Trees
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Use performance metrics: R², MAE, and MAPE
- Visualize model behavior and interpret model fit
- Discuss model limitations and conclusions

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **R² Score**: Measures variance explained by the model
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average magnitude of prediction errors
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Percent-based error metric

## 🧰 Requirements
